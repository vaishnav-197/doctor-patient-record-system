# doctor-patient-record-system
This project is an academic assignment for DBMS course in Cochin University of Science and Technology. 
We here propose a doctor patient handling, managing system that helps doctors in their work and also patients to view medical progress.
Each time a user visits a doctor his/her medical entry is stored in the database by doctor. Next time a user logs in he may view his/her entire medical history as and when needed. At the same time a doctor may view patients medical history even bore the patient visits him. This allows for an automated patient doctor handling system through an online interface.
